- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kipferl-OS, I don't really have any fancy or specific description to add, this github will be mainly for testing various little project that I will be handling around while studying for UNI(and working as well). Feel free to add any comments/suggestions to the upcoming stuff I will be adding here, cheers!
